### Methodology in Machine Learning
1. view the amounts in each label to check if the data have the imbalance problems  
2. remove the features with low varience, usually we can set a threshold(may be is 90%) as the unacceptable value for the features
3. use the decomposition algorithms the make some features selection. such the pca, rfe.
